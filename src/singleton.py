    Metaclass that turns the class into a singleton lazily initialized

    It uses a class variable to store the single instance which is created at
    class creation by calling its constructor with no arguments. This means
    that this method does not support classes that require initialization
    parameters. However, singletons should not need initialization parameters
    as they only have one instance.

    The private class attributes __instance and __new are used internally.
    If they want to be used by the class, another attribute name should be
    provided through the `instance` or `constructor` keyword argument of the
    class respectively.

    Usage:
        class SingleExample(metaclass=Singleton):
            def __init__(self):
                pass

        class SingleExample2(metaclass=Singleton, constructor='__qwerty'):
