class Singleton(type):

    Metaclass that turns the class into a singleton

    It uses a class variable to store the single instance which is created at
    class creation by calling its constructor with no arguments. This means
    that this method does not support classes that require initialization
    parameters. However, singletons should not need initialization parameters
    as they only have one instance.

    Usage:
        class SingletonExample(metaclass=Singleton):
            def __init__(self):
